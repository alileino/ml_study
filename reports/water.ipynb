    "# Data set\n",
    "The task for this project is to do metal ion prediction using the provided data set. The data set has 3 explaining features Mod1, Mod2 and Mod3 and 3 objective values Pb, Cd and c_total. The latter is the sum of the first two. There are 201 training examples. For each objective triplet there are 3 measurements, so every 3 subsequent training examples have the same objective values. Low concentration samples (few ions) are overly represented, and high concentration samples are not. \n",

    "In the following pairwise matrix scatterplot c-total and the modulator features are shown. The colors represent different c-total values, and they are not binned in any way. The plot shows no clear linear dependencies between c-total and the modulators. The modulators themselves show some linear dependence.\n",

    "Leave-1-out cross-validation leads to perfect prediction on this data set. This is because every triplet of the objective values is repeated 3 times, and the modulators don't have much variation for the same sample. This shows that the error of the modulators is small enough that it itself is not enough to cause prediction errors which affect the c-index. Here is the resulting plot, with small randomness added to the plot so that one can clearly see all c-index values are exactly 1.\n",

    "From the cindex plots, we can see that neighbor values that are multiples of 3 tend to be better. This is mostly due to the fact that the data was repeated 3 times for each training example. The neighbor value $k=6$ seems to be the best in this data set, although it is somewhat biased because of the structure of the data set. The predictions are much better than the baseline prediction (mean).\n",

Also, the full code for this report can be found in the github page under analysis/water_ion.py.\n",
